            <p> This site was made in collaboration between Jermaine Presbery, Sean Maher, Simon Kwilinski, and Trenton Metcalfe. <br>
                It contains each member's resume and a machine learning model that suggests a location to the user based on their weather preferences. <br>
                The model is a voting classifier based on RandomForest, MultiLayerPerceptron, SupportVectorMachine, and a KNearestNeighbors classifiers. </p>
